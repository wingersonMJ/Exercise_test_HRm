# Overview

## Background:
Engaging in aerobic exercise within days of concussion is the standard of care treatment approach [[ref](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37316185/)]. While the precise dosage of exercise that is optimal for treatment of post-concussion symptoms and other impairments remains a popular research topic, consensus has generally been reached that exercise at an intensity, duration, and frequency that does not exacerbate symptoms is considered safe and beneficial for recovery [[ref](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37316210/), [ref](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30715132/)].  

A common practice for prescribing exercise in clinical settings is through the use of an exercise test [[ref](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40135995/)]. In the controlled clinical setting, a graded exercise test can gradually increase heart rate from resting to moderate/high intensity over the course of 10-15 minutes. Clinicians can monitor patients during the test, looking for one of two stopping criteria: a) an increase in symptoms that is more than mild, b) reaching the point of self-reported exhaustion (typically reported through a percieved exertion scale), or a heart rate that approaches the patients age-predicted maximum heart rate (220bmp - age, HRm), also considered exhaution. Uppon reaching a stopping criteria, clinicians can measure the highest heart rate achieved on the test, refered to as the symptom threshold, or the maximum heart rate the patient is able to tolerate before symptoms increase or exhaustion is reached. The clinician is then able to prescribe 80-90% of this highest heart rate as the heart rate target (HRt), which provides a patient-specific exercise recomendation to perform as part of their recovery. Past work has shown that a HRt of 90% of the highest achieved heart rate during testing for 20-30 minutes, 4-5 days per week is safe and effacous for recovery [[ref](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35489100/) - our work!].  

## Knowledge Gaps:
Though exercise testing for the purposes of deriving patient-specific HRt's is standard clinical practice, no research has systematically described performance during exercise testing with respect to the progression of patient heart rate, rating of percieved exertion, or symptom exacerbation. Demographic, injury, and clinical factors associated with the stopping criteria, or the highest heart rate achieved on the test, have also not been investigated.

Last, though exercise testing is ideal for developing personalized HRt prescriptions for adolescents after concussion, alternative methods exist for deriving heart rate prescriptions in the abscence of exercise tests. One such example is to prescribe 50% of the patients age-predicted maximum heart rate (220bpm - age, HRm). However, this recommendation is an approximation of what it is believed patients will achieve if they had recieved an exercise test, and the actual value ranges from 50-80% of HRm, a wide range that lacks evidential support. 


## Objective:
1. To compare demographics, injury, and clinical characteristics among participants with concussion based on exercise test stop criteria: symptom exacerbation vs exhaustion.

2. To determine if demographics, injury, or clinical characteristics are associated with the maximum achieved heart rate on the exercise test.

3. To evaluate the accuracy of a 50% HRm method for prescirbing a HRt compared to the HRt derived from exercise testing.
